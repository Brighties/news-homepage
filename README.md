## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

This CSS rule ensure that the body overflow is automatically and does not pop up suddenly. This is useful in cases where the navigation menu expands upon clicking it. If the page does not overflow originally, the navigation will cause the page to expand.

```css
body {
  overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

### Continued development

Add more pages and make the newly added pages responsive.
